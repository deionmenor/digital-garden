I recently decided to build a digital garden—a place where I can share my thoughts, notes, and ideas in a more organic way than a traditional blog. Here's how I built it using Astro.js.

## Why Astro.js?

Astro is a modern static site generator that's perfect for content-focused websites. Here's why I chose it:

1. **Performance First**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, making pages incredibly fast
2. **Content Collections**: Built-in support for organizing and managing content
3. **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown with frontmatter
4. **Great DX**: TypeScript support and a fantastic developer experience

## The Structure

My site has four main sections:

- **Homepage**: Shows recent notes and blog posts
- **About**: Information about me and the site
- **Digital Garden**: Evolving notes and thoughts
- **Blog**: More polished, traditional articles (like this one!)

## Design Philosophy

I wanted something clean and minimal, inspired by tools like Notion and Claude. The design focuses on:

- Readability with comfortable line lengths and spacing
- A clean color palette that works in light and dark modes
- Card-based layouts for browsing content
- Clear typography hierarchy

## What's Next?

Some features I'm planning to add:

- Search functionality
- Tag filtering
- RSS feeds
- Related notes/posts suggestions
- Reading time estimates

Stay tuned as this garden grows!
