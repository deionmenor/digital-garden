Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve over time, standing in contrast to transient notes like fleeting thoughts or daily journals.

## Key Characteristics

**Concept-oriented**: Each note focuses on a single, atomic idea rather than a topic or project.

**Densely linked**: They reference and connect to other notes, creating a [web of interconnected knowledge](/garden/knowledge-graph).

**Continuously refined**: Unlike blog posts that are published and left static, evergreen notes are revisited and improved as understanding deepens.

## Why Write Evergreen Notes?

Traditional note-taking often results in notes that are write-only—captured once and never revisited. Evergreen notes encourage:

- Active engagement with ideas over time
- Compound growth of knowledge
- Discovery of unexpected connections
- Development of original thinking through synthesis
