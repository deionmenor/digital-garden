This habit is inspired by Julia Cameron's Morning Pages routine.

Making a habit of starting your day with writing can help clear your thoughts.

Cameron's technique suggests three entire pages of handwritten stream-of-consciousness writing in the early morning.

Writing your thoughts helps clean out the mind static that you often have when you begin your day. Thoughts like "what's on my to-do list", "shouldn't I be worried/anxious/scared of x", "how do I feel about y".

During the process of writing your morning pages, you may end up thinking about something that you would never have had the time to think about otherwise. 

The output of this activity is never meant to be read by anyone else. You aren't even expected to reread your morning pages the next day. Treat these pages as exercise, a way to stretch the mind so that it is well-prepared for a day's worth of work.

For people with ADHD, writing in the morning can be a cathartic feeling. Writing down nagging thoughts, ideas, and feelings can help remove the burden that may be carried on for the rest of the day.
