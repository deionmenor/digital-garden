A knowledge graph is a network of concepts connected by meaningful relationships, resembling the associative structure of human memory.

## How They Work

Instead of hierarchical folders or linear documents, knowledge graphs organize information through **bidirectional links** between atomic units of knowledge.

```
Idea A ←→ Idea B
   ↓         ↓
Idea C ←→ Idea D
```

Each node represents a distinct concept, and edges represent relationships or connections between them.

## Benefits Over Traditional Organization

**Non-linear thinking**: Ideas can relate to multiple concepts simultaneously, not confined to a single category.

**Emergent insights**: Connections between seemingly unrelated notes can reveal patterns and generate new ideas.

**Natural retrieval**: Following links mirrors how we naturally recall information through association.

## Building Your Graph

Start small with [evergreen notes](/garden/evergreen-notes) that focus on single concepts. As you write more notes:

1. Link related concepts naturally within your writing
2. Revisit older notes to add new connections
3. Look for clusters and patterns that emerge
4. Let the structure evolve organically

The value isn't in the graph itself, but in the thinking process it encourages.

## Tools

Popular tools for building knowledge graphs include Obsidian, Roam Research, and Logseq—though the concept can be implemented with simple markdown files and links.

*The power of a knowledge graph grows exponentially as you add more nodes and connections.*
