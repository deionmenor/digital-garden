      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to my digital garden! This is a space where I cultivate and share my thoughts,
        ideas, and learnings as they grow and evolve over time.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Digital Garden?</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike a traditional blog where posts are polished and published once, a digital garden
        is a collection of evolving notes and ideas. Think of it as a public notebook where
        thoughts are planted as seeds, tended to over time, and allowed to grow organically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notes in my garden are works in progress. They may be incomplete, experimental, or
        constantly evolving. This approach allows for more exploration and less pressure to
        have everything perfectly formed before sharing.
